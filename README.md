# PathPlanning

This repository contains the following pkgs:

- path planning using rrt* module and the communication module for that. The package is integrated with ROS as service (rrtStar_point, and rrtStar_msgs_point).
 
- path planning using the extended-rrt* module and the communication module for that. The package is integrated with ROS as service (rrtStar_volume, and rrtStar_msgs_volume).

Extended-rrt* computes a feasible path for an object/robot with a volume in the workspace, while rrt* computes the path for a point in space.

TODO: there are some matlab codes for visualizations the workspace, found path, ... . It is located in stand-alone module. I should be updated later.
